There is a legend—with\n        variations—about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this\n        method of storing milk.\n      </Truncate>\n    </Box>\n  )\n}\n"],"mappings":";;AAKA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,SAASC,GAAG,EAAEC,QAAQ,QAAQ,OAAO;AAErC,eAAe,SAASC,KAAK,GAAG;EAC9B,OACE,oBAAC,GAAG;IAAC,QAAQ,EAAE;EAAI,GACjB,oBAAC,QAAQ,QACP,+EAAyD,imBAUhD,CACP;AAEV"}
