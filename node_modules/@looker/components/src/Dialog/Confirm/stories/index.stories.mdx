# Confirm

Confirm provides a helpful composition of dialog components to drive the most common use case: driving user action to confirm or cancel a specific outcome.

# Standard Use

Confirm makes use of the render prop pattern to provide `open` and `close` functions to be called when needed.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

Updating color and text of the button

<Editor code={storyCritical} />

# useConfirm

If you want more control over markup and state, we provide a custom hook that returns the opener function and rendered confirmation dialog. The following example illustrates how the opener can be called outside the Confirm component.

```jsx
;() => {
  function handleConfirm(close) {
    alert('You deleted it')
    close()
  }

  const [confirmationDialog, openDialog] = useConfirm({
    confirmLabel: 'Yes, Delete all',
    buttonColor: 'critical',
    title: `Delete all`,
    message: 'Are you sure you want to delete all?',
    onConfirm: handleConfirm,
  })

  return (
    <>
      {confirmationDialog}
      <ButtonOutline onClick={openDialog}>useConfirm</ButtonOutline>
    </>
  )
}
```

# ConfirmLayout

We've found that most Dialogs involve the same common elements: Title, Message, a primary action (usually "Confirm"), and a secondary action (usually "Cancel").

To help standardize that layout, we created the `ConfirmLayout` component for composing the relevant pieces. This is handy if you need something like Confirm in a separate context (e.g. when you need to lay out surface content for use in [`Dialog`](/components/dialogs/dialog)).

<Editor code={storyCritical} />
