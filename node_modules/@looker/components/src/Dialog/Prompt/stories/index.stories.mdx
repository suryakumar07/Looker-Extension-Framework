# Prompt

The `<Prompt/>` component is similar to the `<Confirm/>` component in that you can use either to render a dialog.

However, unlike the `<Confirm/>`, the `<Prompt/>` component comes with a built in `<InputText/>` component. This makes it more suitable for use cases where you want to grab user input before performing an action.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Prompt} exclude={excludedProps} />
