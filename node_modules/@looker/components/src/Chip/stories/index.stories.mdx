# Chip

The `Chip` component can represent multiple interactive elements in the same area, such as a multiple values on a single filter or a list of email addresses.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

The `onClick` handler is called when when the user clicks anywhere on the `Chip` except for the x icon.
This icon appears when `onDelete` is defined and calls that intead when clicked.
`onDelete` is also called via the delete key. Neither callback is called when `disabled` is true.

<Editor code={storyClickAndDelete} />

## MaxWidth

The width of the `Chip` will accomodate its contents, by default. Setting a `maxWidth` will cause any overflow text to be truncated with ellipses. The full text will show in a tooltip on hover.

<Editor code={storyMaxWidth} />

## Prefix

Text in the `prefix` will render before the children, in normal font-weight, with a colon after it.

<Editor code={storyPrefix} />

## Removable

The following is an example of a collection of removable chips.

<Editor code={storyRemovable} />

# IconLabel

The `Chip` component provides the prop `iconLabel` to customize the icon label. Hover over the the `x` icon to see the tooltip.

<Editor code={storyIconLabel} />
