# Card

At its most basic, a `Card` is a slightly styled container that organizes groups of content, usually linking to a more in-depth view of that content. It can have elevation and a border. A default `Card` makes no assumptions about the content you place inside of it or the size of your card, but you should follow the guidelines to be sure you use them effectively.
