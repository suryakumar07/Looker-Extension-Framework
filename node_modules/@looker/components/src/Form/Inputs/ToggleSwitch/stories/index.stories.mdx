# ToggleSwitch

The `<Checkbox />` component renders a single checkbox element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldCheckbox />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldCheckbox />` instead as it provides label support.

The `ToggleSwitch` component is essentially a decorated checkbox that is either toggled on or off. For accessibility reasons you should always provide a label with your toggle switch, you can use the `<FieldToggleSwitch>` component to quickly generate an accessible toggle switch with proper labeling. Its size can be changed using the `size` prop, which accepts px value as a number. Its default size is 20px.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

## Checked Property

The `<ToggleSwitch />` component can be rendered in two different states: "on" and "off"

<Editor code={storyChecked} />

## Disabled Property

Use the disable property to gray out the ToggleSwitch, making it unclickable.

<Editor code={storyDisabled} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={ToggleSwitch} exclude={excludedProps} />
