# InputTimeSelect

`InputTimeSelect` provides a [`Select`](/components/forms/select)-based dropdown UI for picking a 24-hour time value. This is an alternative to [`InputTime`](/components/forms/input-time), which provides an HTML5-standard time picking experience.

The default implementation provides a dropdown list of times in 15-minute increments, formatted in for a 12-hour clock.

## Intervals

You can choose from any of the following options: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 minute intervals.

We've limited allowed intervals to a few approved options rather than accepting any number. This is to protect against uninteded use where an engineer might specify 1-minute intervals and generate an unusable select box with 1400 options. We also wouldn't want to support bizarre instances of a random numbers like 37 or 152 minute intervals.

## 12- or 24-hour formatting

Depending on readability preference, the time picker can format the labels in either 12- or 24-hour time. Regardless of label formatting, this component returns a 24-hour time formatted string when changed.

## Controlled Component

Consistent with all other inputs, `InputTimeSelect` accepts `value` and `onChange` props for use in a controlled form setting.

- `value` accepts a 24-hour formatted time string (e.g. `15:45`)
- `onChange` returns a 24-hour time string

## DefaultValue

If you don't want to control the form value externally, but still want to listen for changes, you can still pass in an initial `defaultValue`.
