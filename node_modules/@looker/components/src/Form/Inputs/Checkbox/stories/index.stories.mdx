# Checkbox

The `<Checkbox />` component renders a single checkbox element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldCheckbox />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldCheckbox />` instead as it provides label support.

## Checked Property

The `<Checkbox />` component can be rendered in three different states: checked, unchecked, and "mixed". In addition to the standard boolean, rendering a "mixed" value can be used to indicate that only a fraction of related sub-options have been selected.

<Editor code={storyChecked} />

**Note:** The "mixed" value is only available to the `checked` property and not available to `defaultChecked` property.

<Editor code={storyMixedChecked} />

## onChange Property

`Checkbox` accepts an onChange callback, which can be used for toggling checkbox state.

<Editor code={storyOnChange} />

## Advanced Use: Controlling parent/child mixed states

Using a mixed state checkbox can be used to establish a parent and child relationship between multiple options. This is an advanced use and will likely require bespoke state management. In an attempt to facilitate a standard UX, we've create a hook and state pattern.

This may not be sufficient for your own use case, but it may provide a good starting point and reference for how it should work.

<Editor code={storyMixedStates} />

## Name and ID

A name and ID can be specified in the `<Checkbox />` component. Names are important if the checkbox is used in the context of a form, in which case a name is required for the value of the checkbox to be captured.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

## Disabled Property

Use the disable property to gray out the checkbox, making it unclickable.

<Editor code={storyDisabled} />
<Editor code={storyDisabledChecked} />

## ReadOnly property

`Checkbox` will ignore user-actions on a `Checkbox` with the `readOnly` property enabled, similar to `disabled` but without greying out the option.

NOTE: In HTML specifying `readonly` on _only_ prevents changes to `value` attribute of the checkbox and therefore allowing the user to still check and uncheck the checkbox.

In most cases we emulate the HTML specification where it has an existing decision or feature. However, the specification's behavior around checkboxes with a `readonly` attribute is rather unintuitive.

<Editor code={storyReadOnly} />

## Accessibility

Use `FieldCheckbox` to ensure accessibility. If you must use `Checkbox` on its own, always associate a `label`, either by wrapping it around the `Checkbox`, or using the `for` attribute corresponding to the `Checkbox` id attribute.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Checkbox} exclude={excludedProps} />
