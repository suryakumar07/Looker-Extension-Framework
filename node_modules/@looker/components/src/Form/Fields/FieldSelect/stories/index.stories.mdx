# FieldSelect

The `<FieldSelect />` component is composed of an `<Select />` component and a `<Label />` component. Using `<FieldSelect />` allows for rendering validation messages. By default, the label will render directly above the input field, which is the recommended convention, however this is adjustable with the `inline` property.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />


### FieldSelect Validation

The `<FieldSelect />` component accepts `validationMessage` as a property. This is an object with properties `type` and `message`.

<Editor code={storyValidation} />

If you have multiple fields in need of validation, it is recommended that you wrap them in a `<Form />` component and pass to it a dictionary with key as field name and value as a `ValidationMessage`.

Note: In the current implementation, any `ValidationMessage` set in a `<FieldSelect />` component will be overridden by `ValidationMessages` set in the parent `<Form />` component. Because of this, it is highly recommended that you only ever directly set `ValidationMessage` if a `<FieldSelect />` is outside a `<Form />`.
